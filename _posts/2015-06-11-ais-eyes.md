## How The Grid is teaching its Artificial Intelligence to see and paint

* Color extraction: extract/quantize colors from pictures
* Face detection: emotion recognition, detect salient regions
* Saliency extraction: crop to region, text placement
* Delaunay triangulation: generative backgrounds, picture styling
* Image classification: extract information from pictures
* Sentiment analysis: extract general mood of a picture
* OCR analysis: extract text from images

## Saliency extraction

When we look into a picture we can naturally determine what points get our attention first. A human face, a specific object, a region with higher contrast, those are both examples of salient areas. We can easily recognize those areas, but computers don't. So we have to teach them.
The Grid uses a saliency detection algorithm which analyzes a given image looking for regions of high contrast. In summary, it divides the original image by means of little segments. Those segments are analyzed and just the most contrasting ones are keep. We call them salient regions. 
Knowing which regions are most salient we can now crop the original image to show only those regions --- to fit on any screen size, for example. Or we can place text on top of images avoiding the salient regions. 

## Generative images and image processing

Besides analytics, we can use extracted information from text, images or videos to synthesize new content. We can generate an infinite number of unique images using combinations of different shapes, curves and colors.
We can apply more complex algorithms like Delaunay Triangulation to obtain meshes for favbanners or backgrounds.
Or we can go beyond and use the same algorithm to style existing pictures.

Using our open-source image processing pipeline imgflo we can manipulate images. It is possible to create any image filter and apply them to enhance pictures.
Imgflo is a runtime for Flowhub, a visual programming environment that made it simple to build image processing graphs.
